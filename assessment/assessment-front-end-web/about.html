		<p>
			I am a twenty-something year old wanting to do something new with my life. I have always had a narrow vision on what life was supposed to look like, and often time I missed the point of enjoying the moment. I have be granted the ability to work in different areas and fields, but none have fulfilled my desire to grow and do better. Until I started coding. I was so happy writing my first line of code because it was something that I could do. But it did not stop there. I did my research on how far I could go if I developed my skillset and that is when my joy that was once lost when I left my previous roles came back. I am excited to be on this journey and hope to make it out successfully.
