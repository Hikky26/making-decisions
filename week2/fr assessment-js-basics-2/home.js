//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/* 
    Write an *arrow* function called `greetUser`
    It should have one parameter, `username`
    The function should return a string that says: 
    'Welcome back, [USERNAME]'
    Where USERNAME is the `username` arguement sent in

    For example, if called with `Andrew` as the 
    argument, `greetUser` should return the string:
    'Welcome back, Andrew'
*/

//CODE HERE
const greetUser = (username) => `Welcome back ${username}`
console.log(greetUser('Hikmah'))




//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/* 
    Below is an array of zip codes that are in
    the restaurant's delivery zone. 

    Write a function called `canWeDeliver` that
    takes in one argument, `zipCode`.

    If the zip code passed in is in the array,
    return a string letting the user know they
    are eligible for delivery. If they are not, 
    return a string letting them know that. 

    For example:
    canWeDeliver(84606) 
        // `Sorry, we can't deliver to that address`
    canWeDeliver(85205) 
        // `You're in our delivery zone!`
*/

const deliveryAreaZipCodes = [85205, 85204, 85203, 85213, 85206]

//CODE HERE
const canWeDeliver = function(zipCode) {
    if(deliveryAreaZipCodes.includes(zipCode)){
        return 'You are eligible for delivery!'
    }else if(!deliveryAreaZipCodes.includes(zipCode)){
        return 'Sorry, we are unable to deliver to this area'
    }

console.log(canWeDeliver(85204))


/* 
    Problem 2 Continued

    Now you're going to rewrite your function.

    If you wrote `canWeDeliver` using a loop of
    some kind, write a new function (`canWeDeliverTwo`)
    below, using the `includes` array method. 
    Look it up on MDN if you're not sure how to use 
    it. 

    If you already used the `includes` method, 
    write a new function using some sort of 
    loop (for loop, higher order array method).
    Name your new function `canWeDeliverTwo`.
*/

// CODE HERE
const canWeDeliverTwo = (zipcode) => {
    for(i = 0; i<deliveryAreaZipCodes.length;i++){
        if(deliveryAreaZipCodes[i] === zipcode){
            return 'You are eligible for delivery!'
        }    
    }
    return 'Sorry, we are unable to deliver to this area'

console.log(canWeDeliverTwo(12345))
console.log(canWeDeliverTwo(85204))
