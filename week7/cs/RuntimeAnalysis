Read over the results, and write a paragraph that explains the pattern you see. How does each function “scale”? Which of the two functions scales better? How can you tell?

The append function seemed to have a faster time of execution overall accross each set. As the number of items in the array increased, the time of execution also increased for both the append function and the insert function. However, a trend that was significant trend starting from the medium array. The append function was faster and continued to decrease in time as the array bacame smaller. With this analysis, the insert function seems to have a O(n) function scale because as the number of items in the array increased, the speed to add the items increased non linearally. The Append function seems to be an O(1) function scale as the time seems to be conisitent regardless of the number of items in the array. At first it may have a O(n) relationship but when taking into account each individual value that was added, the time stays the same.
